# Basic VPN Setup Tutorial   
## **Part 1**: Get a free AWS EC2 to run the VPN service  

1. Sign up for a new AWS account to get the free tier. Just follow AWS guide.  

    **Note**: You need a credit or debit card when you sign up.

    > - This is the [sign up page](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email "Sign up your account").  

    > - This is the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/free "Learn about the free tier").  
  
2. Now you already have an AWS account. We can start create EC2 server.

    1. Sign in your account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/console/).  

    2. Choose a region where you want to deploy the server.

2. Next we install outline VPN server in docker. Execute the following commands one by one in the console.  

    1. `` sudo — sh -c ‘apt-get update; apt-get upgrade -y; apt-get dist-upgrade -y; apt-get autoremove -y; apt-get autoclean -y’ ``  

    2. ``sudo curl -sS https://get.docker.com/ | sh``  

    3. ``sudo systemctl start docker``  

    4. ``sudo systemctl enable docker``  

    5. ``sudo systemctl status docker``

    6. ``sudo bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-server/master/src/server_manager/install_scripts/install_server.sh)"``
    
3. Finally you maybe see this. Firewall blocked. Don't worry. Let's configure the security group. Keep the console here and we will use the messages later.
